Welcome to the Oasis workshop and congratulations on starting to learn about web development! Learning about the basic technologies used in this field will allow you to build your own personal projects, website, apps, etc. And it's fun!

## After the Workshop

Well done finishing the workshop! You now have the necessary skills to create your own website from scratch! Soon, you will be able to create web applications using these skills. Moving forward, we would recommend the follow steps to continue developing and learning:

*   Continue reading/following through the tutorials for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the W3Schools website: [https://www.w3schools.com/](https://www.w3schools.com/)

*   After you've got a solid grasp of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## If you couldn't make the workshop

If you were not able to attend, don't worry! There are still many great ways to learn these languages of the web. We'd recommend checking out the resources listed in the [Ultimate Oasis Starting Guide](https://github.com/northeastern-oasis/Ultimate-Oasis-Starting-Guide/tree/master/intro-to-web).
