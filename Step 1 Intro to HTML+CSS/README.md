**To get started, open this project in Repl.it, Fork it (you may have to sign in to Github), and then head back here**: [https://repl.it/@chessmyers/EngageWorkshop](https://repl.it/@chessmyers/EngageWorkshop)

`index.html`, which we will work with first, will contain the HTML code that will define the skeleton of your page (what it looks like, without styling). To view what a page looks like, you can open an HTML file using your favorite browser! 

`style.css` will contain the CSS code that changes what your HTML elements look like. To have it work, you will need to connect your CSS stylesheet to your HTML document using the <link> tag in the document <head> tag. This is already done for you, but when you create your own HTML file you will need to do this.

Go through the files in this order: index.html, style.css. Read all the comments and do the challenges to learn these languages!
